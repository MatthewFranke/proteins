  glycine decarboxylase
    The system is a series of enzymes that are triggered in response to high concentrations of the amino acid glycine. 
    The same set of enzymes is sometimes referred to as glycine synthase when it runs in the reverse direction to form glycine
  
  thymidylate synthetase
    An enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP).
    
  enolase
    A metalloenzyme responsible for the catalysis of the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), 
    the ninth and penultimate step of glycolysis. 
  
  methionine sulfoxide reductase
    It carries out the enzymatic reduction of methionine sulfoxide to methionine. 
    Human and animal studies have shown the highest levels of expression in kidney and liver. 
    Its proposed function is the repair of oxidative damage to proteins to restore biological activity.
  
  aspartate ammonia-lyase
